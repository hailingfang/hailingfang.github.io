BA	Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology	Inner Mongolia University	09/2011	07/2015	Huhhot, CN	Paper	Structure-function relationship analysis of 20 kinds of flavonoids of inhibiting HepG2 cell proliferation.	Flavonoids is a kind of polyphenolic substances and distribute in vegetables and fruits broadly. Flavonoids have different anticancer activity due to different structure. The project compare the anti-proliferation activity of 20 kinds of flavonoids, and analyze structure-function relationship between flavonoids and anticaner activity. The research find that: 1) flavones is more efficient than flavanones; 2) flavones' basic structure is important to its anticancer activity; 3) flavanones have weak anticancer function may be cause by losing of 23 doubly bond; 4) 5' have a group is important to its function; 5) phenyl B connect to 3 point is important to its anticancer activity. 
MA	Master of Science in Biology	Beijing Normal University	09/2015	07/2018	Beijing, CN	Thesis	An analysis of codon bias between intrinsically disordered regions and structural domains of orthologous single-copy genes from human, chimpanzee and mouse genomes. 	Codon bias, the unequal usage of synonymous codons, can significantly influence biological processes and organism fitness. The project compared the codon bias of orthologous single-copy genes in IDRs and SDs across the human, chimpanzee, and mouse genomes. Our results show that about 3% of orthologous single-copy genes in human and chimpanzee are significantly different in codon bias between IDRs and SDs, and about 1% in mouse genome. There are 7 gene families in which each gene is an IDRs strong codon bias gene, and 13 gene families in which each gene is an IDRs weak codon bias gene.
