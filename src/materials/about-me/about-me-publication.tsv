I improved the efficiency of the module by optimizing the data structure and program design.

When a phylogenetic tree contains thousands of nodes, manually analyzing such tree become difficult. To address this, I developed a tool that automatically clusters the tree. The code is stored in repository <a href=”https://github.com/benjaminfang/biotools”>biotools</a>.

The website is based on the open project <a href=”https://github.com/statgen/pheweb”>Pheweb</a>, and I ran the data parsing process of Pheweb and modified the webpage to meet our needs. I https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/osca/#THISTLEalso implemented the permutation module named <a href=””>THISTLE</a>.

I developed a program that can identify long repetitive sequences, even when their short segments contain variations. This program can now identify long repetitive sequences that follow a particular simple segment pattern.
