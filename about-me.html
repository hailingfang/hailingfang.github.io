            <div id="myprofile">
                <p>My name is Fang Hailing, and I was born in 1992 in Shandong
                    province of China.
                </p>
                <p>I study biology and  earned a Master of Science degree in
                    Biology in 2018. My recent work focuses on computational
                    biology, including biological data analysis and software development.
                    I believe that computers are important tools for solving problems in biology.
                    My interests include the origins of life, cellular mechanisms,
                    the development of multicellular systems, and the nervous system.
                    I have many other interests, however, I have chosen to focus on
                    biology for now because life is short.
                </p>
                <p>I'm always curious about the world, and learning new things excites me.
                    Applying what I've learned to solve real-world problems gives me 
                    a sense of control over my life and the ability to make a positive 
                    difference in the world. While having many interests may be a good 
                    thing about me, it also poses a problem. It means that my time is split,
                     and I need to balance it with my career. it challenging for me to sustain 
                     my interest in things after gaining a general understanding of them, which 
                     makes it difficult for me to persist and become deeply familiar with my 
                     interests. I struggle with serious procrastination, and if I aim for perfection, 
                     I may never even get started.
                </p>
                <p>I may be a good person and be just.  I prefer to work alone first 
                    and then communicate my ideas with others. Although 
                    I am introverted and hesitant to meet new people,
                    I am talkative around my friends. Nonetheless, 
                    I recognize that I still have a long way to go in getting 
                    to know myself better.</p>

                                    Codon bias, the unequal usage of synonymous codons, can significantly 
                                    influence biological processes and organism fitness.
                                    The project compared the codon bias of orthologous single-copy
                                    genes in IDRs and SDs across the human, chimpanzee, and mouse genomes.
                                    It also analyzed the characteristics of genes that showed different
                                    codon bias between IDRs and SDs.
                                    Our results indicated that about 3% of orthologous single-copy genes in human and
                                    chimpanzee are significantly different in codon bias between IDRs and SDs, and about 1% in
                                    mouse genome. There are 7 gene families in which each gene is an IDRs strong codon bias gene,
                                    and 13 gene families in which each gene is an IDRs weak codon bias gene.
                                    GO (Gene Ontology) and protein domains enrichment analysis show that there are no significantly GO terms and
                                    structure domains was enriched within IDRs strong codon bias genes and genes that from gene
                                    families in which each gene is an IDRs strong codon bias gene.
                                    The protein domains enrichment results
                                    show that the C2H2 zinc figure is significantly increased of IDRs weak codon genes of every
                                    species. There is only C2H2 zinc figures were enriched within genes that from gene families in
                                    which each gene is an IDRs weak codon bias gene, and more than 30% of those genes of every
                                    species contain this structure.

                                <p class="cv-entry-sup-info">In my work in software
                                    development, I often need to parse files,
                                    which can be either binary or plaintext.
                                    To understand the structure and content of
                                    these files, I typically refer to documentation
                                    in the form of descriptive text or tables that
                                    outline the meaning of each field and its
                                    associated data type.
                                    My goal is to create an easy-to-use and
                                    accurate markup language that can be
                                    used to describe the layout of both binary
                                    and plaintext files.
                                    Once I have designed this language,
                                    I plan to use it to document commonly
                                    used file formats in the biological field

                                    However, the language still needs a lot of

                                <p class="cv-entry-sup-info">Several file formats are commonly used to store GWAS related data,
                                    including PLINK files, BGEN files, BAM files, and BESD files.
                                    However, different software is required to perform operations
                                    such as printing basic file information, extracting partial
                                    data from files, and transforming binary data into plain text.
                                    In addition, some of these software packages lack help messages
                                    in the command line. Furthermore, some of the file formats lack
                                    APIs for programming languages.
                                    My project has two main objectives.
                                    First, I aim to develop C libraries that
                                    will contain the core functions necessary for
                                    working with these file formats, as well as
                                    Python APIs that can be used to interface with the
                                    C libraries from Python. Second,
                                    I plan to use these libraries to create a
                                    software utility that can perform operations
                                    on these files more easily. The repository is located

                                    work requirements, and some of the code I created is reusable.
                                    In this project, I developed several Python classes to process

                                <p>Assist in identifying long repeats within bacterial genomes.
                                    Long repetitive sequences are frequently found in bacterial genomes,
                                    and they often consist of short repeated segments arranged in a particular pattern.
                                    For example, long repetitive sequences may be constructed by
                                    four short repeated segments,
                                    labeled A, B, C, and D. In some cases, the C and D segments may be inverted.
                                    These sequences should be classified into the same type of long repetitive sequences.
                                    I developed a program that can identify long repetitive sequences, even when their short
                                    segments contain variations. This program can now identify long repetitive
                                    sequences that follow a particular sample segment pattern.</p>

                                <p>In this project, my main contribution is programming. Specifically, I am responsible for programming tasks.
                                    Under Ting's supervision, I built the data portal called <a href="https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/data/brainmeta/cis_sqtl/">BrainMeta</a>.
                                    The website is based on the open project <a href="https://github.com/statgen/pheweb">Pheweb</a>,
                                    and I ran the data parse process of it and modified the webpage to adapt to our demands.
                                    And also, I implemented the permutation module of <a href="https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/osca/#THISTLE">THISTLE</a>.</p>

                                <p>I primarily assisted with phylogenetic tree clustering in this project.
                                    When a phylogenetic tree contains thousands of nodes,
                                    manual analysis such as clustering nodes can become difficult.
                                    To address this, I developed a tool that automatically clusters the tree.
                                    My tool divides the nodes into groups based on a threshold and collapses the nodes in the same group.
                                    This produces a simplified tree that can be easily plotted. The code
                                    is stored in repository <a href="https://github.com/benjaminfang/biotools">biotools</a>.</p>

                                    I improved the efficiency of the module by optimizing the data structure and program design.
                                    As a result, the running time for the module was reduced from about 2 hours to several tens of seconds for the same data,
                                    compared to the original R script implementation.</p>
