                    <div id="profile">
                        <p>My name is Fang Hailing, and I was born in 1992 in Shandong
                            province of China.
                        </p>
                        <p>I study biology and  earned a Master of Science degree in
                            Biology in 2018. My recent work focuses on computational
                            biology, including biological data analysis and software development.
                            I believe that computers are important tools for solving problems in biology.
                            My interests include the origins of life, cellular mechanisms,
                            the development of multicellular systems, and the nervous system.
                            I have many other interests, however, I have chosen to focus on
                            biology for now because life is short.
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm always curious about the world, and learning new things excites me.
                            Applying what I've learned to solve real-world problems gives me 
                            a sense of control over my life and the ability to make a positive 
                            difference in the world. While having many interests may be a good 
                            thing about me, it also poses a problem. It means that my time is split,
                            and I need to balance it with my career. it challenging for me to sustain 
                            my interest in things after gaining a general understanding of them, which 
                            makes it difficult for me to persist and become deeply familiar with my 
                            interests. I struggle with serious procrastination, and if I aim for perfection, 
                            I may never even get started.
                        </p>
                        <p>I may be a good person and be just.  I prefer to work alone first 
                            and then communicate my ideas with others. Although 
                            I am introverted and hesitant to meet new people,
                            I am talkative around my friends. Nonetheless, 
                            I recognize that I still have a long way to go in getting 
                            to know myself better.</p>

                                        <p class="cv-entry-sup-info thesis-summary"><span>Summary: </span>
                                            Codon bias, the unequal usage of synonymous codons, can significantly 
                                            influence biological processes and organism fitness.
                                            The project compared the codon bias of orthologous single-copy
                                            genes in IDRs and SDs across the human, chimpanzee, and mouse genomes.
                                            It also analyzed the characteristics of genes that showed different
                                            codon bias between IDRs and SDs.
                                            Our results indicated that about 3% of orthologous single-copy genes in human and
                                            chimpanzee are significantly different in codon bias between IDRs and SDs, and about 1% in
                                            mouse genome. There are 7 gene families in which each gene is an IDRs strong codon bias gene,
                                            and 13 gene families in which each gene is an IDRs weak codon bias gene.
                                            GO (Gene Ontology) and protein domains enrichment analysis show that there are no significantly GO terms and
                                            structure domains was enriched within IDRs strong codon bias genes and genes that from gene
                                            families in which each gene is an IDRs strong codon bias gene.
                                            The protein domains enrichment results
                                            show that the C2H2 zinc figure is significantly increased of IDRs weak codon genes of every
                                            species. There is only C2H2 zinc figures were enriched within genes that from gene families in
                                            which each gene is an IDRs weak codon bias gene, and more than 30% of those genes of every
                                            species contain this structure.

                                            broadly. Flavonoids has wide biological activities, such as Antioxidant activity, antibacterial,
                                            anti-inflammatory and anticancer. Flavonoids have different anticancer activity due to different
                                            structure, The project compare the anti-proliferation activity of 20 kinds of flavonoids using CCK-8
                                            method, and analyze structure-function by flavonoids’ anti-proliferation activity to find out the

                                            development, I often need to parse files,
                                            which can be either binary or plaintext.
                                            To understand the structure and content of
                                            these files, I typically refer to documentation
                                            in the form of descriptive text or tables that
                                            outline the meaning of each field and its
                                            associated data type.
                                            My goal is to create an easy-to-use and
                                            accurate markup language that can be
                                            used to describe the layout of both binary
                                            and plaintext files.
                                            Once I have designed this language,
                                            I plan to use it to document commonly
                                            used file formats in the biological field

                                            However, the language still needs a lot of

                                            However, different software is required to perform operations
                                            such as printing basic file information, extracting partial
                                            data from files, and transforming binary data into plain text.
                                            In addition, some of these software packages lack help messages
                                            in the command line. Furthermore, some of the file formats lack

                                            on these files more easily. The repository is located

                                            project during I worked at IMCAS. As my work continued,
                                            I wrote numerous scripts and tools to fulfill my daily
                                            work requirements, and some of the code I created is reusable.
                                            In this project, I developed several Python classes to process
                                            commonly used bioinformatics data.
                                            Additionally, I collected several useful tools that I developed,
                                            including those for phylogenetic tree building,
                                            collapsing and clustering, and long repeated sequence calling,
                                            and added them to this project. The code of for this project is on

                                        <p>Assist in identifying long repeats within bacterial genomes.
                                            Long repetitive sequences are frequently found in bacterial genomes,
                                            and they often consist of short repeated segments arranged in a particular pattern.
                                            For example, long repetitive sequences may be constructed by
                                            four short repeated segments,
                                            labeled A, B, C, and D. In some cases, the C and D segments may be inverted.
                                            These sequences should be classified into the same type of long repetitive sequences.
                                            I developed a program that can identify long repetitive sequences, even when their short

                                        <p>In this project, my main contribution is programming. Specifically, I am responsible for programming tasks.
                                            Under Ting's supervision, I built the data portal called <a href="https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/data/brainmeta/cis_sqtl/">BrainMeta</a>.
                                            The website is based on the open project <a href="https://github.com/statgen/pheweb">Pheweb</a>,
                                            and I ran the data parse process of it and modified the webpage to adapt to our demands.
                                            And also, I implemented the permutation module of <a href="https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/osca/#THISTLE">THISTLE</a>.</p>

                                        <p>I primarily assisted with phylogenetic tree clustering in this project.
                                            When a phylogenetic tree contains thousands of nodes,
                                            manual analysis such as clustering nodes can become difficult.
                                            To address this, I developed a tool that automatically clusters the tree.
                                            My tool divides the nodes into groups based on a threshold and collapses the nodes in the same group.
                                            This produces a simplified tree that can be easily plotted. The code
                                            is stored in repository <a href="https://github.com/benjaminfang/biotools">biotools</a>.</p>

                                        <p>I implemented the <a href="https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#ACAT-V">ACAT</a> module based on R scripts provided by Longda.
                                            I improved the efficiency of the module by optimizing the data structure and program design.
                                            As a result, the running time for the module was reduced from about 2 hours to several tens of seconds for the same data,
                                            compared to the original R script implementation.</p>
